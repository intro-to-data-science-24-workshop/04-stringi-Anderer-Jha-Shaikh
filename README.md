# Advanced String-Processing with `stringi`
## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop run at the Hertie School, Berlin in October 2024. The student-run workshop is part of the course Introduction to Data Science taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2024.

### Session contents
The session provides an overview of the key functions offered by the package `stringi`, which can be used for advanced string processing operations. While can be a bit more difficult to learn than  `stringr`, of which it is an extension, it is much more versatile and therefore suited for handling more complex tasks. The focus of this workshop session is on crucial applications which are especially useful in the stage of preprocessing, e.g. string extraction, pattern matching, and text boundary analysis or working with text data from different locales. The primary learning objectives of the tutorial is as follows:

- Motivate the importance of string-processing, particularly in data science in the context of political science
- Introduce `stringi`, its key functions and potential use cases
- Build a solid foundation in practical application of advanced string processing in a subject such as political science
