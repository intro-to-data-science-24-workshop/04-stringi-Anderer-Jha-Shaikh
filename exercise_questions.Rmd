### Workshop Overview 📝

**Exercise 1**: Dive into **stringi** for hands-on experience in string data cleaning and manipulation! In this exercise, we will explore several core functions of **stringi** that simplify text processing and extraction. Specifically, we will focus on the following features:

- **Normalization** ✍️: Standardizing text for consistency.
- **Sorting** 📊: Organizing strings in a specified order.
- **Joining** 🔗: Concatenating multiple strings seamlessly.
- **Formatting** 🎨: Adjusting string representation to meet specific needs.
- **Counting** 🔢: Determining the frequency of elements within strings.
- **Pattern Searching** 🔍: Finding specific sequences within the text.
- **Locating and Extracting Patterns** 📌: Identifying and retrieving desired segments of text.
- **Splitting** ✂️: Breaking down strings into manageable components.

**Exercise 2**: An interesting exercise where we have scraped Berlin's climate data from its wikipedia page and prepared it for analysis. In this exercise , you’ll see how **stringi** can be creatively applied for **scraping and cleaning numeric data** by treating numbers as strings—a powerful trick in data pre-processing. 🧹 Exercise 2 exist on the Github repository as additional exercise. 

This workshop will show you the versatility and power of **stringi**. 💡

### Let’s Begin! 🚀


```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      eval = TRUE,
                      error = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      comment = NA)
``` 

### Exercise 1 


**Exercise 1.1 **: Scrape political slogans on this wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_slogans) along with their descriptions. 

```{r}  

```  

**Exercise 1.2 **:**Transliteration**- Convert non-ASCII characters in the slogan to their closest ASCII 

```{r}    

```   

**Exercise 1.3 **: **Sorting**- Sort these slogans alphabetically 

```{r}  

```     

**Exercise 1.4 **:**Joining or Concatenation**- Create a variable concatenated_slogans of single character string with each elements separated by "|" 

```{r}   

```  

**Exercise 1.5 **:**Padding/Formatting**- Create a variable padded_slogans to right pad each slogans with spaces so that they all have width of 150 characters. 

```{r}   


```   

**Exercise 1.6 **:**Case Change**-Change the case of all the slogans to uppercase 

```{r}  

```   

**Exercise 1.7 **:**String Counting**- Count the number of times the word "power" exist in these slogans, ignore the case.

```{r}  

```   

**Exercise 1.8 **:**String detection**- Extract the slogans that has the word "Power" in it. 

```{r}   

```   

**Exercise 1.8 **: **Pattern Searching**- Extract and print the slogans that has the word "Power" or "People" in it. 

```{r}    

```  


**Exercise 1.8 **:**String Detection with Pattern**- Extract and print the slogans that has both the word "Power" and "People" in it.  

```{r}  

```  

**Exercise 1.8 **: **Looking behind**- Look for the slogans where word "Black" precedes the word "Power" 

```{r}   


```   

**Exercise 1.9 **: **Looking ahead**-Find the slogans in which the word "to the people" appears after power. 

```{r}    

``` 


**Exercise 1.10 **: **String trimming**-Trim any specific (either slogan or their description) part of the slogan. 

```{r}   

```   


```{r}   

```   

**Exercise 1.11 **:**String split**- Create a dataframe with two columns- slogans and their description in it 

```{r}   

```
